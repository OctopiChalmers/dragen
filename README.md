# DRAGEN - Derivation of Random Generators

To test the tool please run:

```
$ stack setup
$ stack build
$ stack test
```

Please make sure you have `BLAS` and `LAPACK` installed in your system before compiling.

The predictions can be confirmed averaging a large set of generated values.
See file `test/Examples.hs` for an example of this.
